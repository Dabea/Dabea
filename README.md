Design Prerequisites for the resume project

## Goal

The Goal of the project is to design a simple web version of my resume to show off basic HTML CSS and JavaScript knowledge
With a goal in mind that the information should be easily readable

##Technology and Libraries

This will be written HTML CSS3 and JavaScript
    + The project will include JQuery
    + The project will can include Bootstrap
        but may be change to Angular 1.x (1.3 or above will be used likely 1.5.8 Current version)
        biased on complexity of features that will added
    + Animate.css might be a good candidate for the project


Basic idea and layout
   +The page will looks like a regular resume with an edit button to enable editing of all the fields.
    
##Deliverables
will be a zipped file with the libraries and asset included.
There will also be a git page available where pulls can be made.
This is planned for a single time deliverable date with no guaranteed additional versions or support.
The project should be small enough where require js will not need to come in to play.
The Data will he hardcoded

##Project Limits
This will not include custom fonts or designed image or videos.
Will not include a backend with pulled information from the a database with api calls
The data will be hard coded

*LocalStorage would be a good subsite for a Database however due to the design specifications this seems to be outside of the scope of the project and will not 
include my local storage module (this would be a good possible revamp add customer user functionality.
